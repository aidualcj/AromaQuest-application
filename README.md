AromaQuest was a two-week group project aimed at helping individuals who want to renew their perfume selection.

The system assists users by guiding them through a questionnaire that leads to a curated selection of perfumes that best match their preferences. This is achieved through an algorithm that utilizes the Guerlain perfume database. Users can view their results with timestamps and generate a list of favorite perfumes of their choice. Additionally, location-based features have been incorporated.

_ As an educational project, the code is continuously being improved.
